## Description

This study guide was made for the function of keeping track of all progress and notes taken during the coding bootcamp course. It is made with the intention of constantly being expanded throughout the duration of the course. I made this to keep everything organized and in one place so I know where I need to reference back to for any coding specific questions. This solves the problem of having scattered notes throughout ones computer. I learned the function of HTML, Java, CSS and Git.
